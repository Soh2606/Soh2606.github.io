</body> 
 <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; margin: 1cm;"> This article by Vannevar Bush outlines several predictions that he made about future technological advancements. I think that it is pretty remarkable how accurate these predictions were considering the time period (1945). Moreover, Bush was utilising his skills of speculation, drawing from existing technologies to inform himself. I also found his discussion about the need for the scientific process to proliferate because of its endless possibility to be interesting. He acknowledged that the technology we possess has the capability to cause mass destruction.
