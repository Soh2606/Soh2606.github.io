    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; color: black;margin: 1cm;"> In the first episode of this series, Berger establishes that paintings have traditionally been used to convey a sense of power and authority. He discusses that as a result, these pieces of art are not realistic but only representations of the beliefs and social structures of the time. For example, perceptions of women and gender roles. Berger continues to discuss the ways that women are objectified and sexualised in these paintings and how that not only reflects the inherent social structures that governed society at that time but also contributed to reinforcing them. I found this particularly interesting because I have examined the portrayal of women in advertising and created a series of photographs, "Sex Sells", that satirise the concept. As a result, I really enjoy the fact that Berger's examination of popular artwork is informed by a socially conscious and critical thought.
