 <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; margin: 1cm;"> Aureia Harvey is a digtal artist and sculptor who works within the intersection of art and technology. 
    I found the reference to the use of video games as particularly interesting because of the exisiting element of interactivity in an inherently artsitsic form.
     Although video games have not always been considered a form of "art", there is an undeniable quality of artistic and visual aesthetics that permeates game play.
   <br> <br> <br> I have played with the idea of physical interactivity in my own art practice. I have created sculptural settings with edible elements in order to include the viewer.

   <br><br> Another parallel that I was able to draw was the inclusion of the self in the art work. The use of her own facial scans to create sculptures is really interesting to me. 
   I frequently use myself as a subject in my work and I think that the way Harvey puts herself in her art helps me visualisation potential ways to continue incorporating myself in new mediums.<br><br>

     <br><br>Hence, I think that Harvey's work can serve as a source of inspiration for my art as I continue to progress in tandem with technology.
